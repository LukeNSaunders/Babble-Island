# Babble Island


Babble Island was designed as a game for kids. Set on an island in pixel art style, it allows children to start learning foreign languages in a fun way. On the island, there are various characters to talk to and different mini games that can be completed to collect stars. Different stories can be read or requested from ChatGPT based on a topic. A simultaneous translator translates words that are not understood.
